# H-yes-A

## Introduction

This is a simple Remix.run app that fetches data to display in a table. I used Vercel's vo.dev to generate the component for the table to quickly get a decent looking table (mainly because I wanted an excuse to try out shadcn and v0).

## Development

From your terminal:

```sh
npm install
npm run dev


```
